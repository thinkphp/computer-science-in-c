# Divide et Impera

  In Computer Science, Divide and Comquer or Divide et Impera si an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion.
  A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same type (divide),
  until these become simple enough to be solved directly (conquer).
