## Algorithms Design


#### What is computer programming?

Computer programming is the process of writing instructions that are to be executed by computers. These written instructions are often called “code,” as they are written in one of several special programming languages which the computer can understand. Those who can write instructions in one of these codes are called coders, or programmers.  

A programmer’s tasks include understanding project requirements, determining the right programming language to use, designing the solution, coding it, testing and debugging the code, and finally writing documentation that allows their solution to be easily understood by other programmers.

Computer programming is at the heart of computer science and is the implementation portion of software development, application development, and software engineering efforts. It transforms ideas and theories into working solutions.

Basic computer programming involves analyzing a problem and developing a logical sequence of instructions to solve it. There can be numerous paths to a solution, but some are much faster than others. That is why the computer programmer seeks to design the most efficient code.
