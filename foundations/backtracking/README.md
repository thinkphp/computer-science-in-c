# Backtracking

Backtracking is a systematic way to iterate through all the possible configurations
of a search space. These configurations may represent all possible arrangements
of objects (permutations) or all possible ways of building a collection of them
(subsets). Other situations may demand enumerating all spanning trees of a graph,
all paths between two vertices, or all possible ways to partition vertices into color
classes.
What these problems have in common is that we must generate each one pos-
sible configuration exactly once. Avoiding both repetitions and missing configura-
tions means that we must define a systematic generation order. We will model our
combinatorial search solution as a vector a = (a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n ), where each element a i
is selected from a finite ordered set S i . Such a vector might represent an arrange-
ment where a i contains the ith element of the permutation. Or, the vector might
represent a given subset S, where a i is true if and only if the ith element of the
universe is in S. The vector can even represent a sequence of moves i
