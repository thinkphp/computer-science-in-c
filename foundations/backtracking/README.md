# Backtracking

  it's a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that
  incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c as soon as it determines that c cannot
  possibly be candidate to a valid solution.
