# String Matching

Naive string matching, also known as the brute-force string matching algorithm, is the most straightforward approach to finding a pattern within a text. Let's discuss it in more detail.


1. Basic Concept:
   The algorithm simply slides the pattern over the text one by one and checks for a match at each position.

2. Algorithm Steps:
   a. Start at the beginning of the text.
   b. Compare each character of the pattern with the corresponding character in the text.
   c. If all characters match, a pattern is found.
   d. If a mismatch is found or after a full match, slide the pattern one position to the right.
   e. Repeat until the end of the text is reached.

3. Time Complexity:
   - Worst case: O(nm), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
   - This occurs when there are many partial matches or when the pattern and text are similar.

4. Space Complexity:
   - O(1), as it only needs a constant amount of additional space.

5. Advantages:
   - Simple to understand and implement.
   - Works well for small texts or patterns.
   - No preprocessing required.

6. Disadvantages:
   - Inefficient for large texts or patterns.
   - Performs unnecessary comparisons, especially when there are many partial matches.

Here's a simple implementation of naive string matching in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> naiveStringMatch(const std::string& text, const std::string& pattern) {
    std::vector<int> matches;
    int n = text.length();
    int m = pattern.length();

    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {
        int j;
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (text[i + j] != pattern[j])
                break;
        }
        if (j == m) {
            matches.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    return matches;
}

int main() {
    std::string text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB";
    std::string pattern = "ABABCABAB";
    
    std::vector<int> matches = naiveStringMatch(text, pattern);
    
    if (matches.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Pattern not found in the text." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Pattern found at positions: ";
        for (int pos : matches) {
            std::cout << pos << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation:
1. Iterates through each position in the text.
2. For each position, it compares the pattern with the corresponding substring in the text.
3. If a full match is found, the starting position is added to the `matches` vector.
4. Finally, it returns all positions where the pattern was found.

While naive string matching is not the most efficient for large texts or patterns, it's often sufficient for simple cases and serves as a good starting point for understanding more complex string matching algorithms.

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail or compare it with other string matching algorithms?
