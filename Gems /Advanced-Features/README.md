# Advanced C++ Features: C++11, C++17, and C++20

## Course Overview
This course covers the significant features introduced in C++11, C++17, and C++20. It is designed for advanced programmers familiar with earlier C++ standards.

inntroduced in each version of the C++ standard, organized into modules for easy learning and reference.
Here's a brief overview of the structure:

The course is divided into three main modules, one for each C++ standard version (11, 17, and 20).
Each module is further divided into sections covering related features or concepts.
The outline includes both core language features and library additions for each standard.
I've added a section for projects and assignments to help students apply their knowledge.
Additional resources are provided for further reading and reference.

This courseware is designed to give students a deep understanding of modern C++ features and how they can be applied in real-world programming scenarios

## Projects and Assignments
1. Implement a thread-safe data structure using C++11 concurrency features
2. Create a file analysis tool utilizing C++17's filesystem library and parallel algorithms
3. Design a generic algorithm using C++20 concepts and ranges
4. Develop a small application showcasing the use of modules in C++20
