Project Euler is a series of challenging ma<mark>the</mark>matical/computer programming problems that will require more than just ma<mark>the</mark>matical insights to solve. Although ma<mark>the</mark>matics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, <mark>the</mark> use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for <mark>the</mark> inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.Project Euler is a series of challenging ma<mark>the</mark>matical/computer programming problems that will require more than just ma<mark>the</mark>matical insights to solve.
