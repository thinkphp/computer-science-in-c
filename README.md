# Computer Science

Computer Science is the theory and practice of computation, algorithms, software systems, data organization, knowledge representation, language, intelligence, learning, and consciousness.

Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, biology is about microscopes or chemistry is about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about tools, it is about how we use them and what we find out when we do. (Michael Fellows and Ian Parberry, “SIGACT trying to get children excited about CS”)

**Getting Started**
-------------------

To get started with the course, please:

1. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC) on your computer.
2. Choose a code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion).
3. Familiarize yourself with the course materials and resources.
4. Join the course discussion forum to connect with instructors and peers.

### Preface

C is a general-purpose programming language which features economy 
of expression, modern control flow, and a rich set of operators. C is 
not a very high level language, nor a big one, and is not specialized to any 
particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its
generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than
supposedly more power languages. C was designed for and implemented on the
UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating
system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications program (including
all of the software used to prepare this course) are written in C.
