# AVL

The AVL Tree is a type of Binary Search Tree named after two Soviet inventors Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis who invented the AVL Tree in 1962.

AVL trees are self-balancing, which means that the tree height is kept to a minimum so that a very fast runtime is guaranteed for searching, inserting and deleting nodes, with time complexity O(log n)
