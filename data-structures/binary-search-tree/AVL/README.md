# AVL

The AVL Tree is a type of Binary Search Tree named after two Soviet inventors Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis who invented the AVL Tree in 1962.

AVL trees are self-balancing, which means that the tree height is kept to a minimum so that a very fast runtime is guaranteed for searching, inserting and deleting nodes, with time complexity O(log n)

- The only difference between a regular Binary Search Tree and an AVL Tree is that AVL Trees do rotation operations in addition, to keep the tree balance.

- A Binary Search Tree is in balance when the difference in height between left and right subtrees is less than 2.

- By keeping balance, the AVL Tree ensures a minimum tree height, which means that search, insert, and delete operations can be done really fast.
