# Network Flow

- A type of network optimization problem
- Arise in many different contexts (CS 261):
- Networks: routing as many packets as possible on a given
network
- Transportation: sending as many trucks as possible, where
roads have limits on the number of trucks per unit time
- Bridges: destroying (?!) some bridges to disconnect s from t,
while minimizing the cost of destroying the bridges

#### Settings: 
Given a directed graph G = (V, E), where each edge
e is associated with its capacity c(e) > 0. Two special nodes
source s and sink t are given (s 6= t)
