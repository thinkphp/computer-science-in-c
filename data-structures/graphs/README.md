## Graph Algorithms

An abstract way of representing connectivity using nodes (also
called vertices) and edges
◮ We will label the nodes from 1 to n
◮ m edges connect some pairs of nodes
– Edges can be either one-directional (directed) or bidirectional
◮ Nodes and edges can have some auxiliary information
