## Graph Algorithms

An abstract way of representing connectivity using nodes (also
called vertices) and edges
- We will label the nodes from 1 to n
- m edges connect some pairs of nodes
- Edges can be either one-directional (directed) or bidirectional
- Nodes and edges can have some auxiliary information

#### Why study Graphs?

Lots of problems formulated and solved in terms of graphs
- Shortest path problems
- Network flow problems
- Matching problems
- 2-SAT problem
- Graph coloring problem
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): still unsolved!
- and many more...
