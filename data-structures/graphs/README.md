## Graph Algorithms

An abstract way of representing connectivity using nodes (also
called vertices) and edges
- We will label the nodes from 1 to n
- m edges connect some pairs of nodes
- Edges can be either one-directional (directed) or bidirectional
- Nodes and edges can have some auxiliary information

#### Why study Graphs?

Lots of problems formulated and solved in terms of graphs
– Shortest path problems
– Network flow problems
– Matching problems
– 2-SAT problem
– Graph coloring problem
– Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): still unsolved!
– and many more...
