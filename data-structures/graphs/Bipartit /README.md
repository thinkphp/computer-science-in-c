### Bipartite Graph

A bipartite graph, also called a bigraph, is a set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. A bipartite graph is a special case of a k-partite graph with k=2. The illustration above shows some bipartite graphs, with vertices in each graph colored based on to which of the two disjoint sets they belong.
