### Graphs
An abstract way of representing connectivity using nodes (also
called vertices) and edges
We will label the nodes from 1 to m edges connect some pairs of nodes
â€“ Edges can be either one-directional (directed) or bidirectional
- Nodes and edges can have some auxiliary information
### Traversal

* In computer science, graph traversal is the problem of visiting all the edges in a graph in a particular manner, updating and/or
  checking their valus along the way. Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal.
