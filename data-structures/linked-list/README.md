Singly Linked list
------------------

In Computer Science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node
by means of a pointer. It's a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. under
the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference(in other words a link) to the next node in the sequence.
