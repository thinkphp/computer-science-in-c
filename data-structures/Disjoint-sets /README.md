# Disjoint-Sets or Union Find

### Disjoint Sets

A set is a collection of elements (no-repeats) 

* In computer science, two sets are said to be disjoint if they have
no element in common. 

* For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets.

• For example, {x, y, z} and {t, u, x} are not disjoint.
