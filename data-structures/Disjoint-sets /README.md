# Disjoint-Sets or Union Find

### Disjoint Sets

A set is a collection of elements (no-repeats) 

* In computer science, two sets are said to be disjoint if they have
no element in common. 

* For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets

• For example, {x, y, z} and {t, u, x} are not disjoint.

### Partitions

A partition P of a set S is a set of sets {S1,S2,…,Sn} such that
every element of S is in exactly one Si 

Put another way:
– S1 ∪ S2 ∪ . . . ∪ Sk = S
– i ≠ j implies Si ∩ Sj
 = ∅ (sets are disjoint with each other)
