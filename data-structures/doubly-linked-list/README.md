# Doubly Linked List Data Structures


### Apps

Here are 2 interesting problems that are well-suited for a doubly linked list implementation:

1. Browser History Navigation System
This problem simulates a web browser's back/forward navigation feature:
- Each webpage visited is stored as a node in the doubly linked list
- Current page is tracked by a pointer
- "Back" button moves to previous node using prev pointer
- "Forward" button moves to next node using next pointer
- When visiting a new page while in middle of history, all forward history is invalidated 

2. Music Player Playlist Manager
This simulates a music player with these operations:
- Songs can be added/removed from playlist
- Current playing song is tracked by a pointer
- Next/Previous song navigation using next/prev pointers
- Shuffle feature (random node access)
- Move song up/down in playlist (node swapping)
- Repeat single song or entire playlist (circular list functionality)

The doubly linked list is particularly good for these problems because:
1. They require bidirectional navigation (back/forward, prev/next song)
2. Need to track current position (current page/song)
3. Require efficient insertions/deletions
4. Benefit from maintaining history/sequence
